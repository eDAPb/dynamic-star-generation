# Dynamic Star Shape Generation (DSSG)
This project came to be part of my advanced Java course in college. It is a JavaFX project that generates animated stars with a different number of vertices on the fly through high school geometry calculations!

## Basics
The project is pretty straightforward to get running. The [JavaFX GUI](https://openjfx.io/) Framework must be installed for the program to compile. Interact with the slider at the top-left to change the number of vertices the star shape generates.
